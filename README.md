## How to run
Clone. `pod install`, open `PicxTale.xcworkspace` to install.

## How to use
Run and you'll see a login screen. Luckily you don't need to login so just tap `skip >>`. And you will see two example
photos which does not contain encrypted message. Tap `Grid` button on the bottom left corner and you'll see the gallery. Tap the `+` button on top right corner, you have a number of choices to add your photo. Choose one and a dialog will pop up to ask you type something to hide into the photo. Do so.

## Something glitchy
The projects has 20 warnings. "Wut?? Are you kidding me?" No, I am talking about this seriously. **All of them are generated by my third-party libraries.** So don't worry. Also, the delete photo function is not implemented. And, **please be patient and hit `refresh` several times to wait for your newly added photo to appear.**
